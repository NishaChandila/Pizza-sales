# Project Title: Pizza Sales Data Analysis with SQL

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the Pizza Sales Data Analysis project! In this repository, we delve into the world of pizza sales data using SQL queries. By leveraging tables such as order_details, orders, pizza_types, and pizza, we aim to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, revenue trends, and distribution patterns.


**Object and Approach:**
Our approach involves utilizing SQL queries, including subqueries and joins, to extract meaningful information from the dataset. We break down the analysis into key components, including total orders, revenue calculation, top-selling pizzas, distribution patterns, and revenue trends over time.


**Key Findings:**
1) Total Orders Placed: We processed a total of 21,350 orders.
2) Total Revenue Generated: Cumulative revenue from pizza sales amounted to $78,242,644.20.
3) Highest-Priced Pizza: The Greek Pizza stood out as the highest-priced pizza at $35.95.
4) Most Common Pizza Size: Large pizzas emerged as the most common size, followed by Medium and Small.
5) Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types: The Classic Deluxe Pizza, The Barbecue Chicken Pizza, The Hawaiian Pizza, The Pepperoni Pizza, and The Thai Chicken Pizza were the top 5 most ordered pizza types.
6) Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered: We analyzed the distribution of pizza categories - Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken - along with their respective quantities.
7) Distribution of Orders by Hour: Orders exhibited varying distribution patterns throughout the day, with peaks during specific hours.
8) Category-Wise Distribution of Pizzas: We identified the distribution of pizzas across different categories.
9) Average Number of Pizzas Ordered per Day: On average, 138 pizzas were ordered per day.
10) Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue: The Thai Chicken Pizza, The Barbecue Chicken Pizza, and The California Chicken Pizza topped the list based on revenue.
11) Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue: We analyzed the revenue contribution of each pizza type, revealing interesting insights.
12) Cumulative Revenue Generated Over Time: An analysis of cumulative revenue over time provided insights into revenue trends.
13) Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue for Each Pizza Category: We identified the top-selling pizzas within each pizza category based on revenue.


**Conclusion and Insights:**
Through comprehensive SQL analysis, we gained valuable insights into pizza sales data, uncovering trends, preferences, and revenue patterns. The findings not only provide valuable information for decision-making within the pizza business but also demonstrate the power of SQL in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets.
